# Getting Started with Static Sites

Static websites are making a big comeback in the web development world, and for good reason. They're fast, secure, and simple to host. In this post, we'll explore why you might want to use a static site and how to get started building your own.

## Why Static Sites?

Static sites have several advantages over dynamic, server-rendered websites:

1. **Performance**: Static sites are blazing fast because they're just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that can be served directly from a CDN.
2. **Security**: With no server-side code or database, there are fewer security vulnerabilities to worry about.
3. **Reliability**: Static sites have fewer points of failure and can handle traffic spikes more gracefully.
4. **Cost**: Hosting static sites is often cheaper (or even free) compared to dynamic sites that require servers.

## The Modern Static Site

Today's static sites aren't the basic HTML pages of the 90s. Modern static site generators allow you to:

- Use templates and layouts to maintain consistent design
- Write content in Markdown for ease of use
- Include dynamic features through JavaScript and APIs
- Process and optimize assets during the build process

## Getting Started

Creating a static site is easier than you might think. Here's a simple process to get started:

```bash
# Create your project structure
mkdir my-static-site
cd my-static-site

# Create necessary directories
mkdir -p src/{pages,layouts,posts,assets}

# Initialize a package.json file
npm init -y

# Install dependencies
npm install marked fs-extra
```

## Building the Site Generator

The heart of a static site is the build script that converts your content into HTML. Here's a simple example:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs-extra');
const path = require('path');
const marked = require('marked');

// Read Markdown files
const content = fs.readFileSync('src/pages/index.md', 'utf8');

// Convert to HTML
const html = marked.parse(content);

// Apply template
const template = fs.readFileSync('src/layouts/default.html', 'utf8');
const page = template.replace('{{content}}', html);

// Write to output directory
fs.ensureDirSync('public');
fs.writeFileSync('public/index.html', page);
```

## Conclusion

Static sites offer a refreshing alternative to complex web applications when your content doesn't need to be dynamically generated on each request. By using modern tools and approaches, you can create fast, secure, and maintainable websites that are a joy to develop and use.
